FURTHER TESTU01 INTEGRATION INTO THE SPRNG LIBRARY

This project further integrates the TestU01 library into the SPRNG library.
Most of the SPRNG random number tests had equivelent tests in the TestU01 library.
This version of the SPRNG library adds those versions of the tests to the SPRNG library.
The new tests have been placed in the subdirectories ./sprng5/TESTS/testu01 and ./sprng5/TESTS/testu01mpi
With testu01mpi supdirectory containing the versions of the tests that support the parallel versions of the tests using MPI.

The TestU01 download can be found at:
http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html
Along with instructions on how to install.
Instructions on how to install SPRNG can be found at:
http://sprng.org/
Using the same instructions that SPRNG Version 5.0 uses.
This project was originally developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
